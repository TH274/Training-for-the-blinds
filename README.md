Training for the Blinds
Training for the Blinds is a mobile application built with Expo and React Native, designed to empower visually impaired users to engage in personalized training exercises. The app provides an accessible interface that supports both text input and voice commands for seamless interaction.

Features
Voice Input: Users can dictate information using their voice, which the app transcribes and processes.
Text Input: Optionally, users can enter information manually for greater flexibility.
Voice-Guided Exercises: Automatically generates customized, voice-recorded exercise instructions tailored to the user's input.
Accessibility-Focused Design: Built with accessibility in mind to ensure ease of use for visually impaired individuals.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Leveraging Expo for seamless operation on both Android and iOS devices.
How It Works

Speak or type the information about the desired exercise or training session.
Processing:
The app uses speech recognition to interpret voice inputs or directly uses typed information.
Exercise Generation:
Personalized exercise routines are created based on the input.
Voice Output:
The app guides the user through the exercise with clear, pre-recorded audio instructions.
Technologies Used
